Implementing Big O to array and objects

- Objectives/

  1. Understanding working of array and objects
  2. why adding ele at start of array is costly
  3. compare runtime for built in methods of array and objects

- Object
  unordered are key value pairs, when we don't need order ,
  when we need fast access -- insertion, removal and acessing data
  Big O constant time
  hash maps

- Insertion O(1)
- Removal O(1)
- Searching O(n) //given info is in value somewhere
- Acessing O(1)

- Methods of Objects

  1. keys O(n) -- array with keys
  2. value O(n) -- array with value
  3. entries O(n) -- key and value inside an array
  4. hasOwnProperty O(1)

- Arrays Big O
